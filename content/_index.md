# Welcome!

I am Eduardo Paschoalini, a Computer Science Undergraduate and Kernel Researcher. I also enjoy hiking, fishing and reading...

My interests lie in Operating Systems design, theory of computation and compikers.

This is my infrequently-updated site, which contains some documentation of things Iâ€™ve done, my resume, and some blog posts Iâ€™ve written, enjoy ðŸ™‚!
